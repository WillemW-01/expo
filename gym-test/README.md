# Gym Test App

This project serves as a testing environment for my dream gym app. It will consist
of me testing multiple technologies, maybe including many different technologies,
all in this repository. In the end, I might move certain combinations to other
stand-alone repositories for better maintenance.

## Planned Technologies

At the moment, I am planning to test the following technologies for my gym-app:

**Backend**:

- [ ] Django backend
- [ ] Java Springboot backend
- [ ] Flask backend

**Database**:

- [ ] SqlLite db
- [ ] PostGreSQL db
- [ ] Mongo / other Document-based db
- [ ] Firebase

**Frontend**:

- [ ] React Native
- [ ] Normal React frontend
- [ ] Angular (big maybe)

## Features

This is my dream gym app, and I want to include all the feature I would want
that are not available in a single (free) gym app I have found so far. I will
be basing most of my design choices off of my current and favourite gym app, **Strong**.

Here are the features I plan to add:

### Crucial components / base functionality:

- [ ] User creation
- [ ] Data logging and history tracking
- [ ] Data import / export from and to different gym apps (easily migrate)
- [ ] Gym program creation
- [ ] Program selection and execution (gym session)
- [ ] Exercise examples and descriptions

### Non-crucial but definitely planned features:

- [ ] Program split creation (random, bro-split, PPL, full-body)
- [ ] Detailed exercise descriptions / tips / cues from credible Youtubers / sources
- [ ] Calorie tracking
- [ ] Weight and other measurements tracking

### Optional features

- [ ] Interfacing with Garmin / Apple watches for rep-counting (if possible)
- [ ] Messaging / social network
- [ ] Sharing progress / other data with users via social media
